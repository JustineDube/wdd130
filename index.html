        <p>Victoria Falls, located on the Zambezi River between Zimbabwe and Zambia, is one of the most spectacular natural wonders in the world.
             Known locally as "The Smoke That Thunders" due to its massive, misty spray,
              it stretches over 1,700 meters wide and drops 108 meters into the gorge below.
               The falls are a UNESCO World Heritage site, attracting tourists for breathtaking views, adrenaline activities like bungee jumping,
                and a chance to see a variety of wildlife in the surrounding area. 
                It is considered one of the largest and most impressive waterfalls on Earth, offering a truly awe-inspiring experience.</p>
